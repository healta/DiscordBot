##### A simple discord bot that checks if a player or a guild is active on warmane, by making an API request to the armory and returning the result to the discord chat.

##### To run, git clone the repository, cd into it, obtain a token from discord and copy it into the python file, then

```
pip install discord bot
```

```
python discordBot.py
```

Typing !(name) in chat finds if the given player is online

Typing #(guild) in chat finds all online members of a guild
